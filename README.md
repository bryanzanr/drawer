## How the Applications Work

The application is a simple playground templates that are combined each other. The specification that has been made are as follows:

1. The application is inspired by yearly review which like to be showed in popular application that has a lot of user interaction inside it. 
2. It was created for approximately 1 day as I'm still quite hard to get motivation before reaching near deadline. 
3. I really like to see how my written articles or notes that I've been prepared all this time can finally provided in such a unique perspectives. 

More detailed information can be found on the program source code.

Design Decision:
* Download the provided SwiftUI template that can also be run in the playground I guess. 
* Try to combine several templates into one project. 
* Modify the application so that it can met the purpose that I want express.

try to open up your simulator.
